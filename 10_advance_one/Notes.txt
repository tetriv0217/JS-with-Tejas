3.fetch('',{options})

Theory question on fetch
Fetch returns a promise.
The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — even if the server response is an HTTP error status. You can also optionally pass in an init options object as the second argument (see Request).

Once a Response is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled.
Eg:-
Suppose there is 404 error from browser that is a response from the api and "NOT AN ERROR"

4.Fetch has a seperate "Microtask queue","Priority queue"
