/*

Dom Fullform :- Document Object Model

Window => Document => HTML
HTML has two bodies: - Head,Body 
  1.Title -> Title Node
  2.Meta,Meta has attributes

1.To get class we use className instead of class

2.document.getElementById('className')

3.innerText and textContent difference is that innerText gives the vivsible code while textContent give me the whole content.
innerHTML gives the html as well

4.query Selector all gives NodeList and its different from array.To select a different item,use[] and then apply the attributes.You can use forEach loop to iterate



5.getElementsByClassName is a HTMLCollections and does not allow any looping.
document.getElementsByClassName('list-item')
  a)const tempClass = document.getElementsByClassName('list-item')
  temp class is an html collection.
  b) covert this into array using Array.form(HTMLCOLLECTION VARIABLE)
  const covertedArray = Array.from(tempClass)
  c)Do all the stuffs you want to do
