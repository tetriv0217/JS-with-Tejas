/*

Window => Document => HTML
HTML has two bodies: - Head,Body 
  1.Title -> Title Node
  2.Meta,Meta has attributes

1.To get class we use className instead of class
2.document.getElementById('className')
3.innerText and textContent difference is that innerText gives the vivsible code while textContent give me the whole content.
innerHTML gives the html as well
